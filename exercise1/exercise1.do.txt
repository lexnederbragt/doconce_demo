===== Exercise: my first exercise =====

Here goes a general introduction to the exercise.

!bsubex
Predict what this code will do

!bc pycod
a = 2
b = 3
for i in range(a, b):
    print(i)
!ec

!bans
Prints `2`
!eans
!esubex

!bsubex
Modify the program so that it prints 2, 3 and 4.

!bans
There are many ways to do this. We will show two of them.
!eans

!bsol
!bc pycod
a = 2
b = 5
for i in range(a, b):
    print(i)
!ec
An alternative:
!bc pycod
a = 1
b = 4
for i in range(a, b):
    print(i + 1)
!ec

===== Exercise: my second exercise =====

Here goes a general introduction to the exercise.

!bsubex
Implement this difference equation in Python
and generate a plot for values of $x$ from 1 to 10.

!bt
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1} = 1.5 x_n -20
x_0 = 20
\end{equation}
!et

!bsol
!bc pycod
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = [20]
i = 1
while i < 10:
    x.append(1.5 * x[i-1] - 20)
    i = i + 1

plt.plot(x)
plt.show()
!ec

!esol
Question without code answer:
Can you think of an example case that has this difference equation as model?

!bans
Not really
