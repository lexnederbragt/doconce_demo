* status
  - most works
  - can run make WHAT=<targets>
    - but can use both slide and slide1 and slide11
  - can run make for all
  - see below
* currently, any change to any file in do_files/*.do.txt triggers recreation of ALL targets
  - find a way to make correct dependencies by collecting them from scripts/*.prepare.sh
    and putting these in a do_dependencies.mk file
  - reuse `DO_FILES   := $(shell grep -o do_files\/.*do.txt ../scripts/${BASENAME}.prepare.sh)`
* references no longer work in ipynb?
* change ../img/file.png to img/file.png an d make symlink to img folder in src and pub folders?
  - also add to documentation
* change *.compile.sh  back to *.commands.sh
* doconce clean removes *.commands and *.compile.sh. How to fix?
* adjust readme with new structure
  - add `make clean`, `make cleanall`
  - add `make -n | grep Target`
* add rst output
* code/code1.py and ../data/exp_growth.csv should be dependencies for include1
* add `pyhid`, `pyout` and `pycod-e` environments
