* adjust readme with new structure (including `make clean`, `make cleanall`)
* currently, any change to any file in do_files/*.do.txt triggers recreation of ALL targets
  - find a way to make correct dependencies by collecting them from scripts/*.prepare.sh
    and putting these in a do_dependencies.mk file
  - reuse `DO_FILES   := $(shell grep -o do_files\/.*do.txt ../scripts/${BASENAME}.prepare.sh)`
* make clean does not remove *.deck.html, *.deck.pdf, *.reveal.html and *.reveal.pdflatex
  - cannot add $(TARGETS_SLIDE) because then these would _always_ be reomved...
* add rst output
* code/code1.py and ../data/exp_growth.csv should be dependencies for include1
* add `pyhid`, `pyout` and `pycod-e` environments
