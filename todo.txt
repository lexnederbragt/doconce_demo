* status
  - most works
  - can run make WHAT=<targets>
    - but can use both slide and slide1 and slide11
  - can run make for all
  - see below
* currently, any change to any file in do_files/*.do.txt triggers recreation of ALL targets
  - find a way to make correct dependencies by collecting them from scripts/*.prepare.sh
    and putting these in a do_dependencies.mk file
  - reuse `DO_FILES   := $(shell grep -o do_files\/.*do.txt ../scripts/${BASENAME}.prepare.sh)`
* redo include1, still has ../do_files
* doconce clean removes *.commands and *.compile.sh. How to fix?
* adjust readme with new structure (including `make clean`, `make cleanall`)
* add rst output
* code/code1.py and ../data/exp_growth.csv should be dependencies for include1
* add `pyhid`, `pyout` and `pycod-e` environments
