* currently, any change to any file in do_files/*.do.txt triggers recreation of ALL targets
  - find a way to make correct dependencies by collecting them from scripts/*.prepare.sh
    and putting these in a do_dependencies.mk file
  - reuse `DO_FILES   := $(shell grep -o do_files\/.*do.txt ../scripts/${BASENAME}.prepare.sh)`
* doconce clean removes *.commands.sh. How to fix?
  - change to *.commands does not help either
* make clean followed by make removes pdf generation from slide1.commands.sh
* add rst output
* some HTMLs have `PDF cannot be displayed in your browser. See .doconce_figure_cache`
  - copy the required file from `.doconce_figure_cache/`
* code/code1.py and ../data/exp_growth.csv should be dependencies for include1
* add `pyhid`, `pyout` and `pycod-e` environments
* remove ipynb-*-src.tar.gz file?
* add titles to text1, reference1, include1
