===== Plain text =====

Here is some plain text.

Now we add some python code with output:

!bc pycod
total = 0
for number in range(10):
   total = total + (number + 1)
print(total)
!ec

!bc pyout
55
!ec

===== Explanation =====

Let's explain some of this code
(setting the code to be unexecutable):

The `for` loop:

!bc pycod -t
for number in range(10):
   total = total + (number + 1)
!ec

Goes through numbers 0 to 9 and adds 1 more than each number to the `total` variable.

===== Figure =====

See figure ref{PythonDict} for an illustration that explains the python dictionary concept.

===== Math =====

Now we add some mathematical formula:

!bt
\begin{equation*}
K_n = rwTK_{n-1}\left (1 - \frac{K_{n-1}}{H}\right ) - K_{n-1}.
\end{equation*}
!et
