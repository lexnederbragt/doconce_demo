## Exercise: my first exercise

Here goes a general introduction to the exercise.

### a)
Predict what this code will do

```{python}
#| eval: false
a = 2
b = 3
for i in range(a, b):
    print(i)
```
::::::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
#### Solution

Prints `2`
:::

:::::: {.cell .markdown}
### b)

Modify the program so that it prints 2, 3 and 4.
::::::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
#### Solution

There are many ways to do this. We will show two of them.


```{python}
a = 2
b = 5
for i in range(a, b):
    print(i)
```

An alternative:

```{python}
a = 1
b = 4
for i in range(a, b):
    print(i + 1)
```

## Exercise: My second exercise

Here goes a general introduction to the exercise.

### a)

Implement this difference equation in Python
and generate a plot for values of $x$ from 1 to 10.

$$
x_{n+1} = 1.5 x_n -20
x_0 = 20
$$

::::::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
#### Solution

```{python}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = [20]
i = 1
while i < 10:
    x.append(1.5 * x[i-1] - 20)
    i = i + 1

plt.plot(x)
plt.show()
```

### b)

Question without code answer:
Can you think of an example case that has this difference equation as model?

::::::
::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
#### Solution

Not really.

### c)

Another question without code answer.
::::::

::: {.content-visible when-profile="solutions"}
