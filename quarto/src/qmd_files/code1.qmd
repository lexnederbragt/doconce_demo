<!-- Variant for non-slide outputs -->

Here is some plain text.

Now we add some python code with output:

```{python}
total = 0
for number in range(10):
   total = total + (number + 1)
print(total)
```


Let us check the type:
```{python}
print(type(total))
```


This code has an error but we will allow it to explain it.

```{python}
total = 0
for number in range(10):
   total = total + (number + )
print(total)
```
