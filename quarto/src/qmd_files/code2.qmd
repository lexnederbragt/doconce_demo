## Variant for slide outputs

Here is some plain text.

Now we add some python code with output:

!bc pycod
total = 0
for number in range(10):
   total = total + (number + 1)
print(total)
!ec

Let us check the type:
!bc pycod
print(type(total))
!ec

!bnotes
These are speaker notes. They should appear by pressing `s` or `n`
!enotes
