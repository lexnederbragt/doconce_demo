## Exercise: My second exercise

Here goes a general introduction to the exercise.

### a)

Implement this difference equation in Python
and generate a plot for values of $x$ from 1 to 10.

$$
x_{n+1} = 1.5 x_n -20
x_0 = 20
$$

#### Solution

```{python}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = [20]
i = 1
while i < 10:
    x.append(1.5 * x[i-1] - 20)
    i = i + 1

plt.plot(x)
plt.show()
```
