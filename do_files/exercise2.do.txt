===== Exercise: my second exercise =====

Here goes a general introduction to the exercise.

!bsubex
Implement this difference equation in Python
and generate a plot for values of $x$ from 1 to 10.

!bt
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1} = 1.5 x_n -20
x_0 = 20
\end{equation}
!et

!bsol
!bc pycod
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = [20]
i = 1
while i < 10:
    x.append(1.5 * x[i-1] - 20)
    i = i + 1

plt.plot(x)
plt.show()
